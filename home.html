                                    day. While playing this rollerblades i accidentally crash at the 
                                    car that has already park at high speed i can't control the rollerblades 
                                    and i don't know how to stop it because i just a newbie in this activity.
                                    I had a wound on my knee and there are so many bloods that came out 
                                    and because of that when my parents found out that i had an accident since 
                                    they don't allow me to use it again and they hide it from me. While i was in
                                    the rooftop and finding my speaker i saw the rollerblades and i was thinking 
                                    those happy and enjoying moments i decided to clean it and hide it under my

                                    When i was in my junior highschool my classmates decided to try to
                                    play a skateboard then we go to skate park and we saw some pro skateboarders
                                    at the park and we ask them if they can help us in the basics. And after that
                                    some of my classmates already got the basics such as riding the skateboard
                                    trying some ollies in the rail, while me i was trying to perform a ollie and 
                                    what happens is my shoes got a small hole on it. As i learn the basics trying some ollies while i was going
                                    home and suddenly an heavy rain just happen and we decided to ride the skateboard very
                                    fast but my wheels got stuck in a small rock and i fell in my skateboard. After that
                                    i learn that i need to be more extra careful on that because that's not easy riding a
                                    skateboard in fast phase.

                                    When i was in my junior highschool in my first grade i decided to join into a 
                                    badminton team just because my classmate use to play into that team and i want
                                    to be his teammate. Before going to a tryout i decided to play with him and i 
                                    don't expect that he smash the shuttle cock very fast and i was thinking that 
                                    he can teach me some of his skills in badminton. Afterwards i decided to attend
                                    into a tryout and luckily i became a varsity player in our school. The sad part 
                                    is that teammate of mine just transfer into other school, while we are going into
                                    a badminton match with other schools i see him playing on that school, my other
                                    teammate have the chance to match up with him suddenly we lose to him. And while
                                    waiting for my match i feel that i don't wanna see him in other school and the 
                                    match has been started i was not in a mood in playing that score of the other 
                                    opponent just increase and i want to remember all of the skills that he teach me 
                                    so i tied the game and in my turn i just have perfect timing on planning smash 
                                    and after that i win in this first match but in the second match i was loss my 
                                    momentum and i didn't win.

                                    When i was in my senior high i use to play basketball with my classmates 
                                    and that's how we met each other. In having a basketball schedule in the court
                                    in our school and after that game we all became friends. And suddenly in my first
                                    second year of college while playing basketball at the outside of our house while i was
                                    getting a rebound i landed my one leg and my kneecap just twist luckily my grandfather is there
                                    to turn back the kneecap slowly and after that we went into orthophedic at Quezon city just
                                    to see the xray and to find out if there's a problem in my kneecap. I feel sad because i
                                    won't able to play basketball again and the next year i decided to attend into a theraphy
                                    session so that i can barely walk again and luckily i feel happy few months later i decided
                                    to train my legs so it can be strong and my cousins are inviting me to play with them but 
                                    i only do passing the balls and shooting around because i still feel the trauma inside me.
